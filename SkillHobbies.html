							<h3>Leadership</h3>
							<p>As a former Flight Sergeant at the 15 Royal Canadian Air Cadets Squadron in Medicine Hat, AB, I was in charge of leading a flight of 30+ cadets in drill-marching activities. I also helped organize fun, team-building activities for younger cadets, such as marksmanship and orienteering.

							<h3>Collaborative Partnership</h3>
							<p>As a PASS leader, I facilitated numerous Supplementary Instruction lectures for CHEM 201 at the University every week. My role involved attending lectures for the supported course, taking notes, and identifying areas where students needed additional support. I also provided extended sessions to help students prepare for midterm and final exams. A key aspect of my role was fostering a collaborative partnership with the course instructor, regularly communicating to align on course requirements and student needs. I also maintained strong partnerships with fellow PASS leaders, attending team meetings to share insights and strategies for improving student engagement. As seen in my Creative section, I created handouts and learning aids to support students' learning. Balancing academics with this leadership role taught me essential skills in teamwork, communication, organization, and time management, all while working in a collaborative and supportive environment. </p>

					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>Through my research on quadrupedal locomotion, I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills, particularly with computer software. I became proficient in tools like plot digitizers and Microsoft Excel, utilizing various functions to measure equine lengths at different vertebrae. This experience sharpened my attention to detail and ability to navigate specialized software for data analysis. Overall, my expertise in data collection and interpretation has prepared me to contribute to research projects requiring precision and creativity </p>

						<h3>Sales & Customer Service</h3>
							<p> I have a vast amount of experience in the retail environment. During my 2+ year tenure as a Technology Sales Associate at Staples Canada, I have learned effective communication skills for greeting customers, fostering conversations, and practicing conflict-resolution. 
								Through my position at Staples Canada I was able to foster strong sales capabilities. Namely I learned to leverage product knowledge, find creative solutions for customer needs, and cross-sell protection plans and tech services through a wholistic top-down selling approach. </p>
